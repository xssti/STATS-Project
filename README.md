This is a Github Repository of my STATS Final Project - 
UNDERGROUND AIR QUALITY USING MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION AND ANOVA 

Data Overview - 

Some mammals burrow into the ground to live. Scientists have found that the quality of the air in these burrows is not as good as the air aboveground. In fact, some mammals change the way that they breathe in order to accommodate living in the poor air quality conditions underground.
Some researchers (Colby, et al, 1987) wanted to find out if nestling bank swallows, which live in underground burrows, also alter how they breathe. The researchers conducted a randomized experiment on n = 120 nestling bank swallows. In an underground burrow, they varied the percentage of oxygen at four different levels (13%, 15%, 17%, and 19%) and the percentage of carbon dioxide at five different levels (0%, 3%, 4.5%, 6%, and 9%).

Descritpion of Variables - 

1. Response (y): percentage increase in "minute ventilation," (Vent), i.e., total volume of air breathed per minute (Continuous Variables)
2. Potential predictor (x1): percentage of oxygen (O2) in the air the baby birds breathe (Continuous Variables)
3. Potential predictor (x2): percentage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air the baby birds breathe (Continuous Variables)
Total Number of Observations - 120

Type of statistical analysis performed on the dataset - Multiple Linear Regression and ANOVA
